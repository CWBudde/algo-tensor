# Runtime Kernel Performance Notes

<!-- From github.com/cwbudde/go-pocket-tts internal/runtime/ops/PERFORMANCE.md @ 9faba38; go-whistle dropped it.
algo-tensor change: the package path, go-whistle's benchmarks next to go-pocket-tts', and the state of the acceleration
points. -->

This package intentionally started with deterministic, single-threaded CPU kernels as the correctness baseline for
safetensors-native inference.

## Current benchmark entry points

Run:

```bash
go test -bench . -run ^$ ./ops
```

Benchmarks include, at go-pocket-tts' FlowLM and Mimi shapes:

- `BenchmarkMatMulFlowLM`
- `BenchmarkLayerNormFlowLM`
- `BenchmarkAttentionFlowLM`
- `BenchmarkConv1DMimi`, `BenchmarkConv1DMimiParallel`
- `BenchmarkFrameDecodeThroughput`

and at go-whistle's shapes (width 512, 8 query heads of qk 48 and v 64, 375 encoder frames for a 30 s clip):

- `BenchmarkLinearWhistleQProj`
- `BenchmarkMatMulWhistleScores`
- `BenchmarkAttentionWhistleEncoder`, `BenchmarkAttentionWhistleDecodeStep`
- `BenchmarkConv1DWhistleDepthwise`, `BenchmarkConv1DWhistlePointwiseParallel`

`go test -bench . -run ^$ ./tensor` runs the kernel benchmarks (dot, axpy, GEMM, softmax, layer norm).

## Optional acceleration points (correctness contract unchanged)

1. `MatMul` and `Linear`: SIMD/assembly kernels for inner-product loops. Done: `tensor.MatMulTransB` (NEON 4×4 blocks
   on arm64), `DotProduct` and `Axpy` (NEON, AVX2+FMA).
2. `Softmax` + masking: fuse max/exp/sum/normalize pass and mask application.
3. `LayerNorm`: vectorized mean/variance reduction and affine fuse.
4. `Attention`: fuse `QK^T` scale + mask + softmax where memory reuse is possible.
5. `Conv1D`/`ConvTranspose1D`: im2col + GEMM or direct SIMD kernels for common kernel sizes. Done for groups=1: both
   run tiled through `tensor.MatMulTransB`.
6. Parallelization: shard batch/head/channel loops with worker pools while keeping deterministic reduction order where
   parity requires it. `tensor.Parallel` is the shared, bounded pool; work split on it in multiples of the kernel's
   block gives the same bits for any worker count.

Any acceleration must preserve the tolerance targets in `tolerance.go` and, unless it comes with a numerics note, the
golden hashes in `golden_hashes_test.go`.
